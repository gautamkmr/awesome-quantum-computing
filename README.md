# awesome-quantum-computing
A collaborative list of awesome Quantum computing resources and libraries. Feel free to contribute!

## Blog
Quantum computing is hard in a way that a lot of background knowledge is needed to understand what's happening.

* [Quantum computing for the very curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc) - A very approachable introduction. It's long as a web page but shorter than a book.

## Books

* [Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Approach-Jack-Hidary/dp/3030239217) - It has about 1/3 content going over the math needed.

## Papers

* [Andrew's quantum computing paper list](https://github.com/andrewbirkett/quantum/blob/master/quantum-computing-papers.md) - A list of quantum computing papers, sorted by time and organised vaguely into strands based on approach.

## Algorithm

* [Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/) - A catalog of quantum algorithms.
* [A Quantum Random Walk Search Algorithm](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/quant-ph/0210064/)

## Online Courses

* [Quantum Computing on brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/courses/quantum-computing/) - Learn to build quantum algorithms from the ground up with a quantum computer simulated in your browser.

## Libraries

* [Q.js - Quantum Jascript](https://quantumjavascript.app/) - A quantum circuit simulator, drag-and-drop circuit editor, and powerful JavaScript library that runs right here in your web browser. Its API documentation also goes over some basic concept and background knowledge.

## Cloud Services

* [Amazon Braket News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-braket-get-started-with-quantum-computing/) - A news blog post.

## Social

* [Quantiki](https://www.quantiki.org/) - A social portal for everyone involved in quantum information science.
* [Washington Quantum Computing Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Washington-Quantum-Computing-Meetup) - A group for anyone interested in Quantum Computing and Quantum Information in the Washington DC area.
